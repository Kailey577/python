Discussion:
1. List and describe in your own words the six steps in the software developÂ­ ment process.

step 1: analyze the problem, figure out the exact problem and what you need to do
step 2: determining the specifications, describing what the program will do
step 3: creating a design, how the program will work, algorithm
step 4: implementing the design, typing out the program in a computer language
step 5: testing and debugging your program, finding errors
step 6: maintaining the program, keep updating and developing your program ,

5.Why is it a good idea to first write out an algorithm in pseudocode rather than jumping immediately to Python code?
-writing out an algorithm in pseudocode helps you plan out how the program will work and what it will do, creating steps
to follow
